# pornhub_performer_data_analysis_and_performers_predictions
Final Project for the Ironhack Data Analyst course. Analysing Pornhub performer (pornstars and models) data: predicting video views, pornhub ranking and suggesting alternate/similar performers

Dataset at : https://www.kaggle.com/data/206700

Merged the two files (pornstars and models) in one file

Predicted:
- video views (used regressions and random forrest)
- pornhub ranking (with and without the pornstar/model built-in ranking)

Also in the archive (rec 1 and 2) is a project built with Flask / html /css where I implement the recommendation engine built in "suggest a pornstar" in a mini-site 
To run it, download the archive, open and run it with an ide like pycharm and have fun with it :)
